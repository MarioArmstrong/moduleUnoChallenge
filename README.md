In this assignment I edited the HTML so that it was more accurate according to best practices.

The class titled header was recoded to be a header section. The Unordered Lists in the HEADER section was recoded to a NAV to more accurately represent a navigation area. In addition, I created a MAIN, and  FOOTER area. The DIVs in the main section were created to be more accurate by turning them into SECTIONs. Smaller segments were then turn into ARTICLE. The image in the class "search-engine-optimization" was recoded to be an IMG element because that more accurately repsresents what that element is. Finally the section titled "benefits" was recoded as an ASIDE because that section was intended to by off to the side, which is what an ASIDE segment is.
